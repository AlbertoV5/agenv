Hello Agent frontend-speedster!

You are working on the "Layout & Navigation" batch at the "UI Views" stage of the "Workstream Viz" workstream.

This is the thread you are responsible for:

## Thread Summary
Create the HTML shell, CSS styles, and navigation components.

## Thread Details
- Create `src/web/views/layout.tsx` - Base HTML layout with JSX
- Create `src/web/views/styles.ts` - CSS as template literal (embedded)
- Include: header with title, main content area, basic responsive layout
- Color scheme: Use status colors (green=completed, blue=in_progress, gray=pending, red=blocked, yellow=cancelled)

Your tasks are:
- [ ] 02.01.01.01 Create src/web/views/layout.tsx with base HTML structure
- [ ] 02.01.01.02 Create src/web/views/styles.ts with CSS (status colors, grid, typography)

Your working directory for creating additional documentation or scripts (if any) is: `work/001-workstream-viz/files/stage-2/01-layout---navigation/base-layout/`
