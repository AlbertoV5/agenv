Hello Agent frontend-speedster!

You are working on the "Page Views" batch at the "UI Views" stage of the "Workstream Viz" workstream.

This is the thread you are responsible for:

## Thread Summary
Create the home page showing all workstreams overview.

## Thread Details
- Create `src/web/views/dashboard.tsx`
- Route: `GET /`
- Display: Card grid of all workstreams
- Each card shows: name, status badge, progress bar, task counts
- Link to detail view for each workstream
- Show "current" badge on active workstream

Your tasks are:
- [ ] 02.02.01.01 Create src/web/views/dashboard.tsx
- [ ] 02.02.01.02 Implement workstream card component with progress bar
- [ ] 02.02.01.03 Add status badges and current workstream indicator
- [ ] 02.02.01.04 Wire up GET / route to render dashboard

Your working directory for creating additional documentation or scripts (if any) is: `work/001-workstream-viz/files/stage-2/02-page-views/dashboard-view/`

Use the `implementing-workstream-plans` skill.
