Hello Agent!

You are working on the "Server Infrastructure" batch at the "Foundation" stage of the "Workstream Viz" workstream.

This is the thread you are responsible for:

## Thread Summary
Create the HTTP server using Hono framework with basic configuration.

## Thread Details
- Create `src/web/server.ts` with Hono app setup
- Configure server to serve on configurable port (default: 3456)
- Add static file serving for CSS/JS assets
- Export `startServer(options)` and `createApp()` functions
- Add graceful shutdown handling

Your tasks are:
- [ ] 01.02.01.01 Create src/web/server.ts with Hono app and middleware setup
- [ ] 01.02.01.02 Export startServer(options) and createApp() functions
- [ ] 01.02.01.03 Add graceful shutdown handling

Your working directory for creating additional documentation or scripts (if any) is: `work/001-workstream-viz/files/stage-1/02-server-infrastructure/server-module/`

Use the `implementing-workstreams` skill.
