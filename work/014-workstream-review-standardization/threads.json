        "output": "I've analyzed the working agent's session and synthesized the results of the \"Enhanced Commit Display\" implementation.\n\n### Summary of Changes\n\nThe session successfully enhanced the `work review commits` command by improving how commits and their associated file changes are parsed and displayed.\n\n#### 1. Enhanced Commit Metadata & Stage Support\n- **Stage Name Extraction:** Updated `groupCommitsByStage` in `packages/workstreams/src/lib/git/log.ts` to extract `stageName` from commit trailers, allowing for more descriptive headers in the review output.\n- **Robust Parsing:** Fixed a critical bug in `parseCommitBlock` where multi-line commit bodies (and thus their trailers) were being truncated. This ensures that workstream metadata (Stream-Id, Stage, etc.) is correctly identified.\n\n#### 2. Visual File Statistics\n- **Numstat Integration:** Modified `parseGitLog` to use the `--numstat` flag, providing precise data on lines added and deleted per file.\n- **Summary Indicators:** The commit summary now includes a concise statistical overview (e.g., `(+2 ~1 -0)`) using symbols to represent added (`+`), modified (`~`), and deleted (`-`) files.\n\n#### 3. Improved File Organization\n- **Directory Grouping:** Implemented `groupFilesByDirectory` in `packages/workstreams/src/cli/review.ts`. When the `--files` flag is used, files are no longer shown as a flat list but are instead organized by their directory structure, significantly improving readability for large commits.\n- **Renaming Support:** Added support for displaying file renames with a transition arrow (`→`).\n\n### Technical Validation\n- **Parsing Logic:** The agent overcame challenges with `git log` output formatting where `--numstat` data appears outside the standard commit boundary. The solution correctly associates these statistics with their respective commits.\n- **Verification:** The implementation was verified through TypeScript type checking and manual CLI testing, confirming that \"Human Commits\" and \"Workstream Commits\" are accurately categorized and formatted.\n\nThe workstream for these improvements has been marked as completed.",
