# Opencode Bang Commands

When using Opencode chat, prefix user-invoked CLI commands with `!`.

## Examples

```text
!work status
!work review plan
!work approve plan
!work approve tasks
!work start
!work complete
```

## Notes

- User approval commands should be run by the user with `!`.
- Agent-executed commands run directly without `!`.
